## 📊 **Data Description**

The dataset was sourced from **Kaggle** and contains the following key attributes:

- **Age:** Age of the individual
- **Gender:** Male or Female
- **Chest Pain Type:** Type of chest pain experienced
- **Resting Blood Pressure:** Blood pressure in mmHg
- **Cholesterol Level:** Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- **Fasting Blood Sugar:** Whether fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
- **Resting ECG Results:** Electrocardiographic results
- **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved**
- **Exercise-Induced Angina:** 1 = Yes; 0 = No
- **ST Depression:** Value of ST depression induced by exercise
- **Target:** Whether the individual experienced a heart attack (1 = Yes; 0 = No)
